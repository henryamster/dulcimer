Hello, thanks for checking out my dulcimer collector's app code repository.
My name is Henry and I'm building this app to help folks keep track of their collections.
This app is being built with Node, React, Mongo, Express, and uses Gulp, Scss, and jQuery.
If you'd like to contribute or have questions, you can reach me through github or by sending me an email.
My email address is on my website, https://henryfritz.xyz/
Thanks again!
